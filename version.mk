# Included by makefile.gcc and makefile.vbcc. GNUmakefile passes FORK and
# PFS_REF down so the containers never run git: the repo is mounted from the
# host and git inside refuses it as dubious ownership. Outside a checkout the
# shell call comes back empty and the origin bracket is left out, which is also
# what a build from upstream's ./makefile gets.

# tagged, so their binaries name the tag. Keep tag names to letters, digits,
# dot, dash and underscore: the value travels as a bare token.

# boot.c is the only object that bakes these in, so it alone is rebuilt when
# they change. The file is rewritten only when its content differs, so a commit
# or a change in working state costs one object, not a full rebuild.

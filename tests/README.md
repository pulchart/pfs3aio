# pfs3aio test rig

Two layers of tests for the pfs3aio driver.

## `live/` — proofs that the fixes changed behaviour (fail on broken, pass on fixed)

Each `live/*_live.c` lifts a **real function out of this checkout's driver source**,
compiles it with a small mock, and asserts *correct* behaviour — nothing about
"old vs new". So on a tree that still has the bug the test FAILS, and once the
corresponding fix is applied it PASSES. That is what makes it a proof the fix did
something, rather than a demonstration that always passes.

```sh
zsh tests/live/run.sh                        # test this checkout's source (../..)
SRCROOT=/path/to/other/tree zsh tests/live/run.sh
```

It needs only a host C compiler. On unpatched upstream master all of these fail;
apply the fixes and they pass. Covered:

| test | fix it proves |
|------|---------------|
| `blocksize_live.c`      | logical block size normalized to a power of two (blockshift/blocklogshift agree) |
| `partlimit_live.c`      | partition end saturates instead of wrapping past 2^32 sectors (no inverted partition) |
| `ds_retry_live.c`       | DirectSCSI retry restarts in range instead of re-applying blocklogshift and writing outside the partition |
| `ds_maxtransfer_live.c` | DirectSCSI maxtransfer in native sectors (a 16 KiB MaxTransfer with 4 KB blocks no longer rounds to 0) |
| `freeanode_live.c`      | FreeAnode marks the correct anodeblock in non-split mode |

Not covered by a live test: fixes that are one-liners inside large functions
(e.g. the `numblocks` formula in `NewVolume`) or that are inseparable from the
AmigaOS runtime (the update/commit, cache, directory and geometry paths). Those
are covered by the black-box layer below and by code review in the fix PR.

## black-box AmiFUSE suite — functional / regression / atomicity

Runs the real m68k driver against disk images through
[AmiFUSE](https://github.com/reinauer/AmiFUSE) (amitools/vamos emulation). This
layer passes on both the old and fixed driver — it proves the driver mounts,
reads, writes, formats, round-trips data byte-exactly, survives injected I/O
errors and power cuts, and covers supermode and the >4 GB TD64 path. It is a
strong *no-regression* check, not a proof of any individual fix.

```sh
cp /path/to/pfs.hdf tests/fixtures/small.hdf   # a 512-byte-block PFS3 image
zsh tests/make-supermode.sh --driver /path/to/pfs3aio   # sparse supermode fixture
zsh tests/run.sh --driver /path/to/pfs3aio
```

Requires `amifuse` (+ `rdbtool`) on PATH and a built driver. `fi.py` is the
fault-injection / crash harness the suite drives; see its docstring for the
`FI_*` knobs.

## everything

```sh
zsh tests/run-all.sh --driver /path/to/pfs3aio
```
